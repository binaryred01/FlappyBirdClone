# FlappyBirdClone

I am creating a clone of the game Flappy Bird as practice, using the Unity engine and C# scripts...


1. The assets were added to the scene. The sky and grass have been appropriately layered, the bird sprites have been separated into 3 spirtes. The bird sprite has been given a 2D polygon collider so it obeys the laws of physics. The ground has been given a 2D box collider so that the bird falls to the ground and not through the floor.
